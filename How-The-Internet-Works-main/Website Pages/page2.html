  <h1>Domain Names and ICANN</h1>
  <p>The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers is a non-profit organization established in 1998 to transfer management of the Domain Name System, or DNS, away from the US government to another entity to ensure global participation and the security of the Internet as a whole. ICANN has roots in earlier government projects such as the ARPANET and IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority), which mathematically produces and allocates IP addresses. Following calls for privatization in the 90’s ICANN would go on to absorb the IANA and perform the same functions, which had previously been the realm of the University of Southern California. </p>

  <p>By detaching themselves from a governmental body, ICANN was able to make the Internet a more global, collaborative venture that allowed it realize its full potential, once it was clear that it had surpassed the original goals of the project and should be open and available to the public. </p>

  <p>A domain name is a string of labels that identifies a “place” on the Internet, such as a website, a server hosting a site, or an Internet Protocol resource such as a computer which accesses them. For example, Google.com or Wikipedia.org are domain names for those respective domain networks, and each one must be registered through a domain name registrar, who then pays a fee to ICANN. Domain names, like IP Addresses are vital to infrastructure as they provide a way for computers to distinguish between these different, decentralized entities on the Internet, and allow potentially anyone to stake their claim on a little part of it, just like this web page you’re reading now.</p>
