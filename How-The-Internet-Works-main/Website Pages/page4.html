  <h1>DNS</h1>

  <p>The Domain Name System, or DNS, is the system by which the IP addresses that devices use to identify each other are assigned domain names. Its function has been likened to that of a phonebook, by translating a human friendly hostname into an IP address which the computer and quickly look up, as we it is much easier for us to type www.example.com than 93.184.216.34. As users do not have to be aware of this interface or how it locates the IP, they can continue to use the same hostname to access a service even if its location changes. This is why when a domain doesn’t exist, or the computer cannot find an IP address associated with that domain name, it returns the error “DNS lookup failed”.</p>

  <p>Domain names are organized into subdomains, beginning with the Top Level Domains that include the gTLDs (generic Top Level Domains). These include .com, .info, .net, and .org domains and various country codes like .cn and ,uk. They were established as general purpose domains, and remain the most numerous in use today. Second and third (and beyond) level domain names appear to the left of the top level domain, indicating that it is within that particular network. For example, in webpage.co.uk, .co would be the second level domain, and .uk would remain the TLD, and so forth.  DNS servers are connected in a distributed hierarchy where different servers are assigned to the major domains, like ,com and .net. DNS was created as an open and public communication protocol, for use in government and educational institutions, but that same openness that makes it so flexible also opens it up to cyber attacks. </p>
