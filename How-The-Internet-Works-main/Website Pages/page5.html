  <h1>HTTP & HTTPS Protocols</h1>

  <p>When accessing a website through a browser, we type in an address known as a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). The computer uses the URL to talk to a server via HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) , the language they use to speak to each other. HTTP is a client-server protocol, where the client sends a request and the server sends a response back. This is  what’s called a “get” request, which includes the method GET followed by the document being requested. For example, if you wanted to log in to a page, your computer would send a get request for “login” and return the HTML code for the login page of that site. The complete document is reconstructed from this and other sub documents, which fill describe text, layout, images, video, scripts, and more. </p>

  <p>Though there are often different layers in between, such as modems, routers, and other proxies, the most important elements of the transaction are the client and the server. The browser is always the one to initiate the request. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of HTTP that uses TLS (Transport Layer Security) cryptographic protocols to ensure secure communication over a computer network. HTTPS seeks to authenticate the website being accessed and to protect the privacy and integrity of the data while in transit. Through use of bidirectional encryption, it prevents “man in the middle attacks”, where in which a hacker intercepts packets of information on their intended route for spying or tampering. This authentication requires a trusted third party to sign digital certificates, and while previously expensive and thus limited in use, there has been a greater push towards HTTPS in recent years to make web browsing safer. HTTPS is highly recommended in use over unsecure networks, such as public Wi-Fi, where users are more susceptible to attacks. </p>
