  <h1>W3C, HTML, & CSS</h1>

  <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the language used to tell a computer how we want a webpage to look. By using HTML tags, we can add text, lists, navigation bars, scripts and all the other building blocks that make up a web page. Tags can modify and format these elements as necessary, turning a relatively sparse looking page into something more eye-catching, better organized, and easier to read. Certain elements, like images and video, have their own separate URLs that must be linked so that they can be requested when the page loads. The client sends separate HTTP requests for each of these and displays them as they arrive, which explains why you might find some pages loading faster than others, as they have fewer elements to display. Google famously found early success with its search engine as its lightweight and minimalist presentation meant that their search results loaded faster than anyone else’s. </p>

  <p>However, such a spartan approach is not viable for all sites, who often want color, animations, or some other aspect to make their web page “pop”. While elements can be manipulated individually through HTML, what if you wanted to apply a uniform color scheme to certain elements while ignoring others, or simply create a uniform style across multiple web pages? CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style language that describes the presentation of a document written in HTML. If we think of the HTML code as the foundation of the page, where the information and text and content is written, CSS is the layer above that which defines how it’s all displayed and laid out, from color and font size to animations and other features, linked to in each HTML file to ensure consistency in style. This improves site accessibility and keeping CSS on a separate layer from the HTML code means that users can easily alter the look and feel of a page without changing the actual content, and vice versa. </p>

  <p>W3C, or World Wide Web Consortium, is the main organization that developed these international standards for the Internet. It was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee, a researcher at CERN who submitted the first proposal for the World Wide Web in 1989 and subsequently the first Web browser, server, and web page, as well as the first specifications for URLs, HTTP, and HTML, The aim of W3C is to keep develop and maintain these standards and to keep the internet free and open to all. While they do not own or control the Internet, the following of their guidelines are generally agreed upon to ensure long-term growth for the Web.</p>
