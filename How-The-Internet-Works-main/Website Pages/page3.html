  <h1>IP Addresses, Packets, and Routing</h1>
  <p>In the 1970’s, two researchers involved with the ARPANET project, Vint Gerf and Bob Kahn, developed what was called the Internet Working Protocol,, which would allow different computers to communicate with each other.  This design philosophy of building the Internet, a network of networks, to be based these protocols, meant that any following technology would only have to familiarize itself with these standards in order to integrate itself, with the actual physical layout not being as relevant. Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a unique number, or address, by which it is identified. This is the basis of the Internet Protocol for sending and receiving information, and as such is referred to as an IP Address. </p>

  <p>An IP address is a series of four numbers separated by periods, expressed in a range between 0 and 255. Each one is assigned by the IANA division of ICANN, and then distributed via Internet Service Provider, or ISP, to individual devices. Every individual or business connected to the Internet has two types of IP addresses, private and public, which they use to communicate with other devices within a network and outside of one. For example, the phone you use to connect to a Bluetooth speaker would use private IP address to communicate with those devices in your home network, which is different from the public IP address supplied by your ISP that allows networks outside of your own to identify your home network collectively. </p>

  <p>Public IP addresses can be either dynamic or static. As ISPs assign a pool of addresses for their customers, the old ones are brought back into rotation, as this generally saves costs for the ISP and can have the added benefit of making it more difficult for hackers to target a network interface if an IP address is constantly changing. Static IPs are assigned and remain the same, as the name implies, and while not needed by every type of user, it is vital to those who would host their own server, as it ensures that sites, email addresses, tied to that server have a consistent IP, and therefore route, to their intended recipient. </p>

  <p>A network packet is a unit of data containing control information and user data, also known as a payload. Control information contains the data necessary for delivering the payload, such as network addresses and sequencing information. Since packets themselves are larger messages broken up into units, transmitted, and reassembled on arrival, control information is typically found in the first and the last block of data being sent or stored, known as headers and tailers. While it may seem to us as users that we have a direct, dedicated connection to the online services we access, enabling that access to as many people as the Internet reaches means that data travels in a decentralized, less direct route, so that the integrity of that system is not jeopardized if one connection goes down. </p>

  <p>Special computers, designated as routers, act as digital traffic wardens to direct packets of data to where they need to go, even if each individual packet takes a different path to reach its destination. Thus if one route is “congested”, packets may arrive at slightly different times or out of order, but are reassembled into the whole message upon arrival. Each router keeps track of multiple different paths and automatically chooses the cheapest available path for each piece of data. Sometimes, the most optimal path is not necessarily the most direct. The TCP ( Transmission Control Protocol) manages the sending and receiving of all data as packets. Upon arrival, TCP makes sure that all packets requested were received, and signs off on the delivery.</p>
