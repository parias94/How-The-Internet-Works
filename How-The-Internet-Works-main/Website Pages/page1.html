  <h1>How The Internet Works</h1>
  <p>Previously, we covered the history of the Internet, from its inception as a tool of governments and academics, to an open source of communication, commerce, and entertainment for the whole world. For this series, we will focus on the technical aspects that provide the building block for the Internet and allow it to function as we know it today, rather than the sociopolitical and cultural factors surrounding the technology. First, let’s break down the basics: What is the Internet?</p>
  <br>
  <p>Following US Department of  Defense research efforts into creating a communications network that would survive a nuclear strike, scientists developed the ARPANET, a decentralized system of connecting computers of the day in what was called a “distributed, packet-switching network.” What this means is that instead of a message traveling down a single phone line, and thus cannot complete its journey if interrupted or disabled, the network is split up into many different nodes that offer alternate routes of travel should one be unavailable. Messages would be split into small “packets” and reassembled one they reached their destination, and eventually a nationwide (and later global) expansion of this network would take root as the new millennium neared. </p>
  <br>
  <p>The absence of any central control and the abundance of independently operated networks that make up the Internet mean that no single entity truly owns the internet, even the largest of governing bodies or telecom companies. </p>
