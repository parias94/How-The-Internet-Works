  <h1>How The Internet Works</h1>
  <p>Previously, we covered the history of the Internet, from its inception as a tool of governments and academics, to an open source of communication, commerce, and entertainment for the whole world. For this series, we will focus on the technical aspects that provide the building block for the Internet and allow it to function as we know it today, rather than the sociopolitical and cultural factors surrounding the technology. First, let’s break down the basics: What is the Internet?</p>

  <p>Following US Department of  Defense research efforts into creating a communications network that would survive a nuclear strike, scientists developed the ARPANET, a decentralized system of connecting computers of the day in what was called a “distributed, packet-switching network.” What this means is that instead of a message traveling down a single phone line, and thus cannot complete its journey if interrupted or disabled, the network is split up into many different nodes that offer alternate routes of travel should one be unavailable. Messages would be split into small “packets” and reassembled one they reached their destination, and eventually a nationwide (and later global) expansion of this network would take root as the new millennium neared. </p>

  <p>The absence of any central control and the abundance of independently operated networks that make up the Internet mean that no single entity truly owns the internet, even the largest of governing bodies or telecom companies. </p>

  <p>Computers transmit information in binary units called bits, with eight bits equaling one byte, a thousand bytes equaling one kilobyte, and so forth, scaling upwards as necessary. Both sender and receiver refer to the same clock by which the bits are sent, broken down into individual 1’s and 0’s. The rate at which te system can transmit these bits is called bitrate, and the capacity for the transmission is referred to as bandwidth. </p>

  <p>While using electric wires is cheap and effective over shorter distances, that advent of fiber optic cables, sending information at the speed of light, prevents signal degradation, and it is the deployment of these cables along the sea floor that keeps entire continents connected with each other. Wireless transmitters must convert the binary information into radio waves of different frequencies, and the receiving machines must reverse the process. However, this also runs the risk of signal loss, and so towers must be deployed as signal relays to propagate the transmission over vast distances, and this is the infrastructure that powers our mobile networks today.</p>
